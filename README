# Periodic task system!

This package is multi-architecture enabled.

To build for both amd64 and armhf, on an amd64 host, create the binaries in the architecture
dependent directories. the magic-bin/periodic launch script will do the magic
to find the right architecture and launch the right binary.

To build simply do this:

 # get periodic sources
 1. go get -v github.com/Lupino/periodic/cmd/periodic

 # change to the x86_64 directory and build the binary...
 2. cd magic-bin/x86_64-linux-gnu
 3. GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build github.com/Lupino/periodic/cmd/periodic

 # switch to the armhf directory and build for ARM
 4. cd ../arm-linux-gnueabihf
 5. GOOS=linux GOARCH=arm go build github.com/Lupino/periodic/cmd/periodic

 # go to top level dir and build the snapp
 6. cd ..
 7. snappy build .

This produces a snappy package for you that you can try on your snappy system.

Have fun!
